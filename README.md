I have lately been performing in the Codeforces DIV 2 short contests just for fun and have been solving problems from some time now.
This is basically a compilation of the solutions to some selected CodeForces DIV2-A problems and is intended for beginers. I will try to keep this updated with the recent contests and in a manner that would help beginners get a headstart.
P.S 

c++ has been used as the primary language for the programmes.
